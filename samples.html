        <h2 style="margin: 50px 0 20px 0;"><i>Bad Ritual</i></h2>
        <p>You're finally back in the office, and ready to deal with the artifact that your supervisor wants you to babysit. After she performs a little healing magic, you settle in for a long, boring night watching a stationary box.<br><br>Things don't exactly go as planned.</p><br>
        <div id="br_sample01" style="display: none;">
            <p>Your wounds prickle as you make your way into the office properly, feeling almost comforted. A lot of rookie officers are put-off by Tahira's firmness, but you know better; she's not traditionally doting, but she goes to bat for your team harder than anyone else. You've received more hazard pay under her than any other officer under any other priestess, and while you're not always confident in her presence, you know at the very least that you're safe and well-compensated.</p>

            <p>When she moves, futilely shifting another pile of papers around with no particular purpose, the grace of her body is almost frightening; not like you're scared, but her body almost seems to be moving more than what your eyes can interpret. It makes the whole thing feel unpredictable and otherworldly, and you unconsciously coil because you're not sure where she is at any given time.</p>

            <span style="color: blue;">player_response01</span>: "Reporting for duty..."<br><br>

            <span style="color: blue;">She looks up, squinting as if you've let in a light source only she can see. "I've been trying to get in contact for hours," she reprimands, and you shrug and turn your body so she can see what sort of mess has been made of you. "And the artifact?" she asks expectantly.</span><br><br>

            <span style="color: #800080;">player_response02</span>: "You're looking <i>fantastic</i> as usual!"<br><br>

            <span style="color: #800080">She turns and fixes you with a flat look, evidently choosing to ignore how badly you need to be healed. Not for long— just long enough that you know she's already out of patience for your shenanigans. "With all that mess, I expect you have an artifact for me?"</span><br><br>

            <span style="color: red;">player_response03</span>: "Before I do anything for you, sew me back up."<br><br>

            <span style="color: red;">She doesn't look up at you, or throw out her hand to take the twenty seconds to fix the hole in your side. Her gaze is still sternly focused on the box, blinking slowly; if she blinked quickly her long eyelashes would probably generate enough wind to disturb her papers. "Artifact?" she asks shortly, holding her hand out.</span><br>

            <p>You have it, of course— you didn't get torn apart just to let the demon wander free and clear. You hand her a fist sized chunk of gold, which was what had popped out of the swirling silver cloud of smoke the monster had dissolved into. Sometimes it's minerals, sometimes it's jewellery, once you just got a weirdly ornate fork... but they always leave something behind, then Tahira binds it, and the Archive takes it away.</p>

            <p>In exchange for your shift well-spent, she flicks her fingers in your direction and you feel your wound start to bind up. One hot shower later and you almost think you'll feel normal again; of course, until then here you are. There's an impending assignment you haven't gotten yet. "Watch the box," she says shortly, folding her arms. She almost looks tired, but in an artsy sort of way that mere mortals could never dream of; you don't even have it in you to be jealous, because you get to bear witness.</p>

            <p>"That's it?" You can't keep the rasp out of your voice, as the sensation of your own skin mending is, uhm, horrific. She nods, picking the whole thing up and handing it to you; it's no bigger than a cat, and much lighter. You're surprised when you shake it that <i>it</i> is not the artifact— something rattles around inside. "For how long?"</p>

            <p>She purses her lips and turns away, gently smoothing back her hair that's begun to frizz out of its binds. "Not long. I just need to step out and do a little research— finish your shift here, and I'll be back by then." She starts to gather up a few notebooks, hastily putting pens back in their jars. "It shouldn't do anything," she adds.</p>

            <p><i>Then why is it bothering you so much?</i></p>

            <span style="color: red;">player_response01</span>: "Gotcha."<br><br>

            <span style="color: red;">You fold your arms over your chest and wait impatiently for her to finish collecting her things. She does and breezes by you, smelling like perfume but in an expensive and elegant way that doesn't stick to your tongue— more like a flurry of petals rushing by. This leaves you alone with the box.</span><br><br>

            <span style="color: #800080;">player_response02</span>:"Should I expect my bonus in the mail?"<br><br>

            <span style="color: #800080">As if. She rolls her eyes, and something straightens about her posture as she finishes collecting everything she needs. "I'll see you after your shift," she says shortly, then without further ceremony, hurries out of the room. That leaves you alone with the box.</span><br><br>

            <span style="color: blue;">player_response03</span>: "I've got it covered."<br><br>

            <span style="color: blue;">She nods once, and you get the idea she's trying to keep something from you. For a second she wavers, as if there's an admission coming; but there isn't, and she only finishes collecting her things and makes a swift exit. This leaves you, alone, with the box.</span><br>

            <p>You flop down into Tahira's modern, ergonomic office chair. It's comfortable and urges you to straighten your posture instead of slouching like you are. You ignore it, spinning around because it's a spinning chair and you're pretty sure it's a crime to not take advantage of that with nothing else to do.</p>

            <p>SignetWorks wasn't really what you expected it to be when you were hired. It seems like forever ago, but time really stops meaning anything when you're on perpetual night shift.</p>

            <span style="color: blue;">player_choice01</span>: You were poached from a private company.<br><br>

            <span style="color: blue;">You worked with a small... PI kind of institution. They'd send you out to poke around crime scenes that were purportedly demonic in nature, on behalf of the victim (who would no longer be allowed any involvement in the resolution of the crime), and solve the thing before the formal companies and police could lock it down. It was <i>far</i> more dangerous than what you do now, as it's <i>wildly</i> illegal to 'obstruct justice', so of course you jumped on your opportunity to go legit.</span><br><br>

            <span style="color: red;">player_choice02</span>: Tahira recruited you personally.<br><br>

            <span style="color: red;">It was an accident really; the two of you happened to be at the same gym. You hadn't noticed her standing there, watching you absolutely wail on a punching bag. You had skills, and you absolutely knew that; you'd just never thought to apply them broadly and professionally. Mostly you'd learned it to keep safe and occupied, maybe learn a bit of focus and physical release from the stress of existence. Tahira hadn't made your life less stressful, but at least you get paid for it now.</span><br><br>

            <span style="color: #800080;">player_choice03</span>: You applied for <i>years.</i><br><br>

            <span style="color: #800080;">It took five separate resumes. You remember them all looking differently, as they tend to over the years as you gathered more and more certificates and rankings in various types of unarmed combat. You even learned how to use a few basic weapons, which you'd been told were the basis for the program; <i>take me, I'm already trained and ready to go.</i> The pay was attractive as was the image of the Retrieval Officers. It was somehow gritty and glamorous at the same time, and you'd just kept banging on the door 'til they let you in.</span><br>

            <p>And now here you are, for better or worse. You spin the chair again, blinking a little heavier than what is appropriate for someone on duty. It's been a long night, and while you <i>have</i> slept in the office before, you're not looking for a repeat. This hell-space wins hands down for the worst place on the planet to try and sleep, between the constant haunted moaning from Archives to the Breach department which occasionally shakes the entire building trying to rebind what has come loose.</p>

            <p>And yet <i>your</i> box is silent.</p>

            <p>Usually a demon in the midst of a binding— or even immediately afterwards— kicks up a hell of a fuss, even just on a audio level. There's not a lot of room for them to do anything else, as the binding is foremost physical; as you make another turn around your office-axis, you wonder absently if it hurts. Usually by the time you've dismantled them now into their basest component, <i>you're</i> too injured to be worrying about how they're doing.</p>

            <p>You hardly feel the next few rounds in your chair, although your stomach is threatening to mutiny if you keep acting stupid as you are. As quickly as you dropped into it, you find the chair adventure isn't fun anymore and come to a quivering halt; your vision spins and you rub your eyes to try and refocus, like a grown up.</p>

            <p>And you immediately see that the box is open.</p>

            <span style="color: #800080">player_response01</span>: <i>Panic. Oh god. Panic.</i><br><br>

            <span style="color: #800080;"><i>No no no no no no no no no no no no.</i> Absolutely not, this <i>cannot</i> happen. You gape, open mouthed, with your hands pressed to your face. Where did it go? How did it move? How did it break the bindings, <i>what was being bound?</i> You should have <i>asked</i> if the box was a flight risk, you should have asked what sort of demon, <i>Tahira will kill you and hide your body so good that no one will ever find your bones.</i></span><br><br>

            <span style="color: blue;">player_response02</span>: Stay calm. Artifacts can't move autonomously.<br><br>

            <span style="color: blue;">You let yourself absorb the shock all at once, in slow motion, then exhale the momentum of terror. It can't move on its own. Once a demon is within its artifact, reduced down as low as it can go barring death, of course it can't just pick up and walk away. Retrieval would be impossible if you also had to play needle in a haystack with every random piece of crap in the city. The only way it would have even a fraction of the power required to do that would be if it were some sort of archdemon...</span><br><br>

            <span style="color: red;">player_response03</span>: Punch the desk.<br><br>

            <span style="color: red;">Stupid <i>box</i> stupid <i>demon</i> stupid <i>job</i> stupid <i>boss</i>. You don't even know what was <i>inside</i>, how are you supposed to track it down before Tahira gets back? ...How do you fix the thin crack you left in the desk before she gets back? This is the stupid box's fault, and the stupid artifact wherever it went. You were pretty sure before that nothing short of an archdemon could—</span><br>

            <p>Oh no. Ohhh, no. <i>What</i> would have that sort of power to move autonomously outside of its physical body? An archdemon. <i>Only</i> an archdemon, which is <i>far</i> beyond your position. It is <i>so, deeply</i> out of your depth that you'd laugh if you weren't suddenly terrified. Your eyes flicker to the door and you're suddenly uncertain— what do you even do in this situation?</p>

            <p>One part of you wants to secure the exits, but there's too many. The walls are mostly windows and the door is just an office door. How do you keep something from leaving when you don't know what or how heavy it is? Keeping your ears perked for any noise that sounds like the door or breaking glass, you take a deep breath and drop to your knees, darting under the desk. Maybe getting out of the box was too much, and gravity had to take over.</p>

            <p>The seals weren't broken on the wood, but along the edges the papers with the various symbols and sacred words have peeled away— almost like a cartoon where a bad smell peels the wallpaper. You... you haven't checked to see if there were burn marks, but that's something for after you check and see if there's anything unusual under the desk.</p>

            <p>Please let there be something...</p>

            <p>Altogether it's disappointingly neat: only a few stray pen caps and an ugly discarded bracelet. You... don't know that these items are not the items you're seeking, but it's hard to get your hopes up about things so banal. Maybe in someone else's office you'd side eye the stuff, but Tahira wears a lot of jewellery you don't really ruminate on long enough to judge and you've personally seen her fiddling with small office items absent mindedly.</p>

            <p>You pick up all of it and place it on the desk, trying to slow your breathing a sensible amount so you can get a plan together. You push the chair away, kneeling again to check under one of the fancy drawers; if the object was circular, it might've rolled and you can't rule anything in the room out at this point. There's dust and a ring you're reaching for, and a dull <i>thud</i> behind you.</p>

            <p>You stiffen and turn, finding the bracelet and all the pen caps on the floor again.</p>

            <p>Your options aren't narrowed down, as all the items seemed to have fallen separately. With no physical momentum involved it's difficult to pinpoint which of the items might have initiated the move.</p>

            <p>Stupid <i>crap!</i></p>

            <p>It still could be something else in the room trying to throw you off, but... well you do have a sense for magic, of course, and something tells you despite your inability to really identify and deal with the artifact that it's one or the other. You want to say the bracelet, because... god why would it be the pen caps, but at the same time that would be exactly what the demon would want you to think. A reach for the obvious is a risk you're not willing to take.</p>

            <p>You stuff all of it into your pockets, resolving to run somewhere to get Tahira. She didn't tell you where she was going so you can't call her, and you don't want to incite a panic by calling around. It has to be one or the other— the caps or the bracelet— and you'll find out which one when you find Tahira.</p>

            <p>You turn to leave and feel the thud at your feet; the lot of it is on the floor again, having slipped from your sweater which seems insanely unlikely as your phone is still in there. You're being screwed with— it's only the suspected items that are moving. Does that mean it's neither? Are you about to go charging out into the office with a pocket full of crap, leaving the released artifact on its own?</p>

            <p>The real question, you think, is whether or not you can really risk <i>not</i> doing so.</p>

            <p>Absolutely not.</p>

            <p>But how do you move it if it won't let itself move further than the desk? You experiment a few times and while there doesn't seem to be a hard border where the items will drop, it does seem to have a preference for the table it had originated. You can't even begin to understand why— <i>away</i> from Tahira's bindings seems to be the logical route, but instead it wants to stay near them.</p>

            <p>Or maybe the shit just knows what you mean to do with the artifact once you find it.</p>

            <p>After roughly the seventh attempt to leave the room with the item failing, you need a new plan. The caps are easy enough; just hold them in your fist and their range is limited. The issue becomes the bracelet: it has no clasp, made of a thin gold band shaped into the wire frame of a rectangle and wrapped around the wrist. On top of the wrist there's a set of three large rubies framed with more gold— it's actually an ugly thing to look at, but it looks like it'll about fit your wrist. At the very least, it'll show you whether or not it has control over its physical dimensions or just its position.</p>

            <p>You slip it on.</p>

            <p>Your whole arm vibrates.</p>

            <p>The thing tightens sharply around your wrist, clamping in a way that might have hurt if you weren't already occupied by the horrible torched <i>burning</i> of your skin. You gasp without air, the pain so focused and intense you can't suck in the breath to shriek; the agony moves up to your elbow, the lava travelling through your veins that glow orange through your suddenly fragile-feeling skin.</p>

            <p>Somehow, distantly, you still manage to feel a little bit embarrassed about the handful of pen caps in your pocket.</p>

            <p>You stumble backwards and trip awkwardly on the chair, and you hit the ground ungracefully— again, luckily the burning has reached your shoulder, and your fingers are cracked and ashy by now so you hardly have the brainpower to spare for your tailbone bruising. Raspy and out of breath, you manage to serve some air to your parched lungs and stretch your burning arm out and away from you; and with a burst of energy that recoils so hard you feel like your shoulder's dislocated, your afflicted arm goes limp.</p>

            <p>You breathe again.</p>

            <p>You hardly have a moment for relief, though, because your gaze turns dizzily upwards to try and make sense of what had just happened and you see probably among the worst things that it was possible to see after that ordeal.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="toggle" onclick="togglesample('br01')">Get a Sample!</button>
        <p>After agreeing to partner with the archdemon in order to break your mutual curse, you find out that it isn't all intrigue and espionage; turns out, you still need groceries, which is made much more onerous when you're carting around a demon who doesn't quite get it.</p><br>
        <div id="br_sample02" style="display: none;">
            <p><b>Food Town, 21:30</b></p>

            <p>"Welcome to Food Town. I'm Bulky, the Coupon King, and I'm here to show you all our amazing deals." The teen in the Bulky costume— a creased, sweat-stained approximation of a brown paper bag with enormous, blank googly eyes (that were once upon a time demon-yellow, because no PR department is capable of catching everything apparently)— is obviously darkly aware of her reality. She curtly holds out a coupon book to Eden, who stares blankly.</p>

            <p>"No we're... fine," he says in a damn good approximation of Siruud. He changed in an attempt to more comfortably slip back into disguise, but apparently the night's rattled him already. He seems unaware that he is actively breaking the most sacred rule of non-engagement, holiest in the bulk supermarket.</p>

            <p>"You could be better, if you take Bulky's Deck of Deals," she says with a grim persistence.</p>

            <p>"That will be unnecessary," he insists, irreverent of your actual financial situation which you're sure could be improved by this wonderful coupon book. "We'll just be going <i>inside,</i> $firstname?" As if this is your fault.</p>

            <p>The teen's eyes turn to panic and you sigh. "Please? My boss gets so mad when I don't hand all of them out..." You nod sympathetically and take it, putting your hands firmly on Eden's waist to shuffle him inside, as he looks outright offended that you undermined his authority before this grocery store minor. "Be sure to check out Bulky's Bargain Bin for steep discounts on bread and milk!"</p>

            <p>You work at SignetWorks so you <i>don't</i> have to search Bulky's Bargain Bin for stale bread and slightly turned dairy.</p>

            <p>Eden moves ahead of you impatiently, and you expect him to stomp over to the carts; instead he stands and hovers awkwardly, turning on his heel to glare at you further as if you crafted this building specifically to frustrate him. Eden is a thin veneer— pretty, but you can recognise Siruud plainly in the twist of his mouth. "What's that look for?" you ask, taking initiative and grabbing the cart yourself.</p>

            <p>"I'm at a distinct disadvantage trying to act human here," he snaps quietly, falling into step with you. He can't remove his sunglasses indoors, and it makes him look a little too glamorous for a grocery store with a mascot.</p>

            <p>"Why?" You took him to the one place in the world where every other normal human being is trying desperately to pretend like no one else exists. At worst he'll have to make friendly conversation with someone who mistook him for an employee, and somehow you think he's safe from that assumption with how wildly unfriendly he looks at the moment.</p>

            <p>"I've never <i>been</i> to one of these things before," he hisses, only looking more annoyed when you stare at him incredulously. "For what reason would I have had to come to one of these places?"</p>

            <span style="color: #800080;">player_personality01</span>: "I'm sorry, I've spent this past week under the impression that you eat <i>food</i> and that's why I'm here now," you tell him with a laugh that comes out a little meaner than you really intended it to. You're not sure what's more bizarre: the fact that he's never been to a grocery store, or the fact that he clearly, desperately doesn't want to.<br><br>

            <span style="color: blue;">player_personality02</span>: "For... food?" you ask, as if he were genuinely asking and not just trying to be explosively angry to cover up the fact that he's clearly uncomfortable. "I mean, I don't... know how you would have avoided it?" He clearly has all this time, because he's very closely resembling a vampire at the threshold of a church right now.<br><br>

            <span style="color: red;">player_personality03</span>: "What are you <i>talking</i> about?" you demand, trying to tamp down on the urge to just... shake your fists uselessly at the sky. He's so <i>frustrating</i> and now he's looking at you like you orchestrated the concept of grocery stores personally just to upset his day. "Where the hell else do you get food?"

            <p>"I..." he leans in close, evidently wary of the several older women who linger around the produce and are casting Eden <i>looks.</i> "I hunt, obviously. Predator hunts prey, and demons <i>are</i> historically predators... compared to humans."</p>

            <span style="color: blue;">player_choice01</span>: You laugh, bewildered.<br><br>

            <span style="color: blue;">Surely he's not serious; in a world where it's honestly a major issue for people to not have access to grocery stores, why would he go out of his way to avoid them? It's more than convenience, it's... it's just how food works now. You're sure that broadly speaking, <i>grocery store</i> encompasses famer's markets and neighbourhood gardens and farms and... and every reasonable way to get food.<br><br>Hunting, especially with what he was born with rather than modern hunting tools, just seems difficult and messy and unsanitary and potentially harmful to the ecosystem. So... surely he's joking? He must be waiting for you to look like you believe it, because the alternative is that in this, a decade where computers fit into watches and sophisticated AI can remind you to go to the dentist, Siruud honestly hunts in the woods like some kind of werewolf.<br><br>...if he's kidding, he's playing it so straight that you're starting to get nervous.</span><br><br>

            <span style="color: red;">player_choice02</span>: You curl your nose: gross.<br><br>

            <span style="color: red;">The thought of him covered in blood and viscera, cutting up a carcass among the swarms of flies and maggots and every other parasite that's attracted to dead things... it's unsanitary, frankly, not to mention: does he eat it raw? Right there on the ground like a beast?<br><br>How thoroughly does he clean up afterwards? How long does he keep the meat for? How does he store it? How does he prevent damage to the local ecosystems? The look he's giving you right now indicates some offense to your expression (hopefully just your expression and he isn't digging through your head like he told you he wouldn't) but it's a little more important, you think, that you know he's not out here tempting stomach-rot.</span><br><br>

            <span style="color: #800080;">player_choice03</span>: How complicated!<br><br>

            <span style="color: #800080;">What trouble must he have to go through to eat when he needs to. First he's got to track, then he's got to hunt, and you assume he's taking into account the damage he could do to certain ecosystems by introducing a new predator into the mix that can't, in turn, be taken by anything naturally occurring. Then of course there's the dressing and preservation; does he stick to small game? Does he have some secret means of refrigeration to keep the meat from larger game, or could he subsist on jerky?<br><br>The questions are on the tip of your tongue but frankly, you're not sure you want to know. There's so many ways this could turn out to be an intensely yucky process that you're just not quite comfortable with putting your thoughts into words but... what a weirdly intricate life he leads when not in your direct line of sight.</span><br><br>

            <p>"What are you thinking?" he asks with more trepidation than you expected.</p>

            <p>"Nothing. What would I think?" you say it a little too quickly to sidestep the conversation. With the questions you have for him, you're not sure he wouldn't take offence; mostly at the implication that he's tear-assing through the wilderness like an invasive species, gnawing through raw meat and the parasites that come with. It's not a flattering image and you may not know much about Siruud, but the man likes flattery.</p>

            <p>"I could read your mind," he says, and you frown. "I won't. I haven't. But I could." You roll your eyes in lieu of a response and shove your merry cart long its path to where the water is spraying down the leafy greens, wholly distracting him.</p>

            <p>Moving on...</p>

        <p>All is not well as you're carted off to a mysterious camp in the middle of the wilderness, in the hopes of treating an injury you don't have. Meet the rest of the team, and find out what exactly they plan to do with you.</p><br>
        <div id="h_sample" style="display: none">
            <p>"Good to be back, Jinseo. This is Zed." She puts her hand on your shoulder and you fight the urge to stiffen up; this is it. This is medical examination that you have to get out of, and to make matters worse it's not even Crave. All your plans had been centred around trying to get a slightly known element off your scent, but this is a stranger you're even less familiar with.</p>

            <p>"Good to meet you. If you'll follow me, I can have a look at your wound," he says, gesturing you forward. You stand very still and he gives you a friendly look over his shoulder. "Oh, don't worry. If you made it all the way here without fainting then we probably won't have to put you down."</p>

            <p>"I'm really fi—"</p>

            <p>The doors slam open with such a bang that you jump again, reaching out instinctively for Marsh; realising very quickly that she's not $relative and probably thinks it's strange for you to touch her, you back off and a little ways behind her.</p>

            <p>In the doorway is a man who looks like someone dragged Jinseo behind a horse for several miles before cutting him loose. His hair is longer and tied back with the sole intention of getting it out of his face with no regards to tidiness, and he's let his facial hair grow out in a way that you can't picture on Jinseo despite their identical faces. His clothes are thin and layered and when his eyes meet yours, he scowls.</p>

            <p><i>"Go to bed, Seongho. I'll wake you up if anything happens, Seongho.</i> And yet here you are, trying to process a stranger without telling me," he says in a tone that isn't quite as openly snappish as Mantis, but with the same brooding resentment.</p>

            <p>"That's not true," Jinseo protests, his mouth already flickering into a smile. "I wasn't going to process $them at all."</p>

            <p>"That isn't better."</p>

            <p>Crave, who'd also jumped when the doors flew open, reasserts himself into the fray. "We found Zed here out in the wilderness, and Mantis shot $them. <code>(if: $gender_third contains $pronoun)[(upperfirst: $they)'re](elseif: $gender_singular contains $pronoun)[(upperfirst: $they)'s]</code> being treated for wounds."</p>

            <p>"What <code>(if: $gender_third contains $pronoun)[were $they](elseif: $gender_singular contains $pronoun)[was $they]</code> doing in the wilderness?" he asks, not looking at you, the only person with the answer to that question.</p>

            <p>"Maybe you should ask $them, Trigger," Marsh advises, not smiling like Jinseo still is but only watching. So this is Trigger; a battered looking man who staunchly refuses to look at you.</p>

            <p>In what you're beginning to put together as a characteristic show of petty faux indifference, his eyes don't even flicker to you even though you can tell he's tracking you from his peripheral. "<code>(upperfirst: $they)</code> would have no motivation to answer truthfully if <code>(if: $gender_singular contains $pronoun)[$they was](elseif: $gender_third contains $pronoun)[$they were]</code> a spy."</p>

            <p>"Seongho, be polite," Jinseo scolds, slapping the back of his brother's head. "Don't mind him Zed, he just woke up from his nap—"</p>

            <p>"This is why <i>I'm</i> in charge of security, because you'd let a total stranger wander in—"</p>

            <p>"I don't think Roach's followers are <i>that</i> well versed in subversive espionage, you paranoid jerk."</p>

            <p><i>"You</i> wouldn't. I do." <i>Now</i> he turns to look at you, his eyes narrowing suspiciously. "Go on, then. Entertain us, since my brother's an expert now." Jinseo rolls his eyes with a huff and retreats to stand beside Marsh with his arms folded.</p>

            <span style="color: red;">player_response01</span>: Screw this stupid jerk!<br><br>

            <span style="color: red;">"I don't owe you, or any of you, anything," you snap, quickly backing away from all of them. "I didn't even want to come here in the first place!" Your back hits the far wall, a physical reminder of the cold hard fact that you're stuck here.<br><br>Infuriatingly, Trigger turns to his brother. "Satisfied?"<br><br>"You acted like a dick and $they got angry: like you'd react differently in $their situation?"</span><br><br>

            <span style="color: #800080">player_response02</span>: He isn't exactly convincing you that it's safe to tell them about $relative.<br><br>

            <span style="color: #800080;">You don't have anything to say, and you don't want to lie, so you stare back at him with what you hope is a totally unwavering expression...not that it matters what your face is doing, since he can't see it. It's just important to you that he get the impression that you're not backing down from his challenge so much as you're spitting in its stupid face.<br><br>Infuriatingly, Trigger turns to his brother. "Satisfied?"<br><br>"I don't blame $them for not wanting to talk to you, given how you're acting. You'd do the same thing in $their situation."</span><br><br>

            <span style="color: blue;">player_response03</span>: Well if it makes him feel better, you can cooperate a little bit.<br><br>

            <span style="color: blue;">You're not going to say anything about $relative— it isn't even his business— but you suppose, given all that's happened, that you'd also be a little anxious to understand where the stranger was coming from. "I lived on a farm. I came back from a walk and found a bunch of strangers tearing everything apart."<br><br>Infuriatingly, Trigger turns to his brother. "Satisfied?"<br><br>"How does <i>that</i> prove your point?"<br><br>"It's an impossible to prove story!"<br><br>"Or it's a person caught up in a bad situation reacting with a frankly unearned amount of honesty!"</span><br><br>

            <p><i>"I</i> wouldn't have gotten myself into this situation in the first place."</p>

            <p>"<code>(upperfirst: $they)</code> didn't," Crave pipes up from the sidelines, gnawing at his cuticles. "Manny got them into it."</p>

            Trigger shakes his head in frustration, turning to Marsh. "You've heard what I think. What's the order?"

            <p>"Zed is our guest, for now. We owe $them that much for $their injury; just make sure $they don't wander somewhere they shouldn't." Marsh turns to smile at you, and you watch her carefully to see if she means you harm: quite the opposite, you almost feel a little kindred with her, although you don't understand why. She looks as blank and alien as all the rest of them.</p>
