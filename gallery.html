                        <div class="galleryTextBox">
                            <p><i>Hybrid</i> is a post-apocalyptic Twine game (using Harlowe) wherein the player is Zed, an enigmatic but friendly stranger whose home has recently gone up in flames and ended their lifelong isolation from regular society.</p>
                            <p>They finally venture off of their farm and find that since the world ended, civilization has moved on and has become wholly unfamiliar. They have to team up with a camp full of independent drifters in order to figure out who is the shadow behind all their misfortune, and what this villain wants.</p>

                            <p>The trick with the main menu was making it so that the "About" and the "Credits" would expand when clicked, then collapse when clicked again. This is not an inherent ability within the Harlowe language, as many things are not; it requires a workaround wherein clicking the button replaces the text of the button with a new button that has an inverse functionality, and the information that needs to be conveyed.</p>
                            <p>In the image, you see the "About" expanded to hide the "Credits", but on load both start off collapsed and separated from the "New Game" and, if a save is available, "Continue" buttons.</p>

                            <p>Creating a user-interface was one of those things that got easier the more I looked into it. At first I had a block of code I copied and pasted into each Twine passage, before learning about the magic of the "Footer" passage that will display and run at the end of every slide. This became my lower bar with the heart (leading to the stats page) and the leaf (indicating that the game has autosaved).</p>
                            <p>Besides the interface, once I learned that the footer would also run code inside of it every time, I wrote a few basic blocks that would check and increment stats. This significantly cleaned up each individual passage, allowing me to focus on story content.</p>

                            <p>The stats and displaying said stats are the most complex pieces of code within the game. Since I decided to display stats through visual images rather than readable percentages or simple integers, the issue was raised that I couldn't just infinitely count up; after five images, the page started to look a chaotic.</p>
                            <p>The solution was to increment the stats based on a threshold. Every time a stat hits three, an array (which acts as the actual stat) increments and the stat reverts to zero. For every object within the array, a sprout icon is displayed. Some decisions will remove/add an entire item from an array, and some will simply reset the count of three or add to it.</p>

                        <div class="galleryTextBox">
                            <p><i>Bad Ritual</i> was originally another Twine (Harlowe) game made to experiment with how to set variables while doing the least amount of disruption to the flow of the story. It was translated to ChoiceScript as an attempt to appeal to a wider audience.</p>
                            <p>The player is a completely customisable (though non-visual) entity, whose job it is to clean the streets of the demons who have become a dangerous fact of life for the mortals of Sanctum City. Everything changes the night that, through a series of work-related blunders, the player inadvertantly binds a powerful archdemon to their arm and must turn the world upside-down in order to resolve the situation before they lose their job: or worse.</p>
                        </div>
                        <img src="assets/images/thumbnails/content/content_br1.png" alt="Hair Choice">
                        <div class="galleryTextBox">
                            <p>The challenge for me, coming out of a first draft on Twine, was to minimalize the disruption of character choices from the flow of the story; and with ChoiceScript's end-of-passage choices, how to provide the character with a satsifying amount of choices while not extending the page well past what was sensible or parsable.</p>
                            <p>The choice above is one that had to be edited down significantly. As far as visually building a character goes, I find hair is often one of the main focuses of players. I initially accounted for the length and particular style, but through the eagle-eyed beta testing done by my very patient QA analyst, it was eventually reduced down to something brief but telling that was a satisfying compromise.</p>
                        </div>
                        <img src="assets/images/thumbnails/content/content_br2.png" alt="Height Choice">
                        <div class="galleryTextBox">
                            <p>As well as cutting down the breadth of choices to avoid trapping the player in a never-ending customization spiral, I also wanted to afford to opportunity to set variables without necessarily explicitly telling the player "THIS WILL SET A VARIABLE". I feel like it slows down the pacing to constantly and directly setting variable after variable after variable, so I experimented with letting them set things through interaction with the world.</p>
                            <p>This choice sets the height of the player based on how easily they are able to reach a street sign, having gotten up from where they were sitting and absently reaching for it (or simply seeing it) as they walk by to continue their shift-patrol.</p>

                        <div class="galleryTextBox">
                            <p>Something I started doing just on the cutting edge of "inconveniently late" into the development process of <i>Bad Ritual</i> was customizing the <i>next</i> button. I found it cleaned up my actual story code, as it allowed me to cut a few transistional lines from the actual meat of the narrative and set the pace a bit snappier.</p>

                        <h1>Platforming Pro, 2019</h1>
                        <div class="galleryTextBox">
                            <p><i>Platforming Pro</i> is the working title of a platformer demo made for a project. I was on a team with two others, one of which handled web-coding exclusively and the other who did the level design and artwork. I was responsible for the creation and implementation of all menus, player stats, and most of the writing (save for a few weapon names/descriptions that appear on the website). Outside of strict responsibilities, I also cleaned and standardized our scripts (written by two separate people) and organized our file structure.<p>
                        </div>
                        <img src="assets/images/thumbnails/content/content_p1.png" alt="Main Menu">
                        <div class="galleryTextBox">
                            <p>Occasionally I would find that a menu had been designed and partially implemented before I got to it (as my initial responsibility was the tutorial level and prologue, which you can see behind the main menu screen). The main menu was one of these instances, wherein an entire PlayerPrefs system had been built with a rudimentary stat system built before my involvement.</p>
                            <p>Eventually it fell to me to correct the bugs in the system and to switch it from its own scene (which created issues when trying to move the player from scene to scene without destroying them) to be a part of my tutorial level. I fixed the PlayerPrefs by correcting what was reset and what was saved, and built the "continue" system from scratch (wherein a player can continue from the start of the last level they completed).</p>
                        </div>
                        <img src="assets/images/thumbnails/content/content_p2.png" alt="CC Menu">
                        <div class="galleryTextBox">
                            <p>The Character Creation Menu was built and designed entirely by me from the ground up. At the point in the game it appears, it is meant to set all intial stats and therefore I built it so that it must be taken through, menu by menu, in order to get into the first level.</p>
                            <p>In the menu, the second character (Tahira) is unlocked; this is unusual and used for testing only, as Tahira would not be unlocked until the end of the fifth level. Besides that, all the necessary menus are scrollable (from right to left) and the inventory menu is locked until an equippable item is collected. In the top left, the stats of the player are displayed.</p>
                        </div>
                        <img src="assets/images/thumbnails/content/content_p3.png" alt="Pause Menu">
                        <div class="galleryTextBox">
                            <p>The pause menu was built before my involvement, but underwent multiple modifications based on content we meant it to display and bugs that were introduced as the timing system became more sophisticated. The primary bug was its total lack of functionality partway through development for no discernable reason— the pause button would be clicked and the menu would come up, but the "resume button" we had previously implemented did nothing, the pause button did not unpause it, and it would not switch scenes.</p>
                            <p>In the first stages of development there was a level-unlock menu we meant to be able to access from the pause. As implementation of this failed, I scrapped it and replaced it with the "Respite Scene" wherein the player could reset their player but not switch levels— the only way through was to beat the one you were on, or to continue from where you left off.</p>
                            <p>Eventually I fixed the functionality of the pause menu's actual pause functionality, the opening and collapsing of the menu, and the design, functionality, and accessibility of the "Respite Scene".</p>
                        </div>
                        <img src="assets/images/thumbnails/content/content_p4.png" alt="Respite Scene">
                        <div class="galleryTextBox">
                            <p>The Respite Scene itself was meant to be easy, as it was merely the fullscreen Character Creation menu; however, as Unity proved to us, nothing is easy. There were issues with the character moving to and from the Respite that created player doubles, made the player completely immobile, or made the player immortal.</p>
                            <p>To say that I knew exactly why any of this happened would be a wild exaggeration, but eventually I worked through it and the Respite Scene became wholly functional and visually acceptable.</p>

                        <h1>Renaissance Man, 2018</h1>
                        <div class="galleryTextBox">
                            <p><i>Renaissance Man</i> is a Javascript clicker game, where the object as a Renaissance Painter is to build your art empire, train your apprentice, and rake in a higher class of patrons. There are checkpoints that light up with famous paintings and a faint glow when you achieve them, a banner across the top that changes every few seconds, and gold frames to outline your stats and progress.</p>
                            <p>This was built to be a responsive browser game, applying a new theme to the clicker genre.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="galleryTextBox">
                            <p>The banner is probably one of my favourite parts of this game, and took arguably the least amount of time to complete (making the Venn Diagram of "functionality I was fond of from the start" and "things that are easy" a circle). Every few seconds it switches to another slide of details from three different Renaissance paintings, the total slides being three and therefore including nine detail shots.</p>
                            <p>Visible at the bottom there is also a "News Around Town" section, which accounts for random events that affect your supplies, apprentice (if purchased), income, and the price of supplies. It goes through an array of events, from your apprentice being struck by inspiration and producing double their regular output to dying of plague, that occur randomly every few seconds.</p>

                        <img src="assets/images/thumbnails/content/content_rm2.png" alt="Legacy Stats">
                        <div class="galleryTextBox">
                            <p>The lower half of the page contains the not-immediately-relevant statistics and legacy bars. The legacy bar was particularly tricky to create visually— when you reach an absurdly high amount of paintings produced, the empty circle fills with a random painting and glows faintly golden.</p>
                            <p>There was an issue with making the painting truly random, while simultaneously having the glow appear and not aversely affect the display as a whole. When resized, the bar disappears.</p>
                        </div>
                        <img src="assets/images/thumbnails/content/content_rm3.png" alt="Full Game Menu">

                            <p>This view is the ideal way to actually play the game, as it displays the pure game-features without the added aesthetics of the banner and the legacy menu. This shot also shows what it looks like when the apprentice has been hired; the option to hire another apprentice is removed, and instead changes to the option to mentor.</p>
                            <p>Besides that, changes made have been to lower the price per painting (thus driving up patron demand), supply quantity dropping as paintings are made, and lifetime works counting up as paintings are completed. Not immediately obvious features are the fluxuation in supply price (every few seconds it recalculates a whole number value between 95gp and 105gp), the checkbox for supply delivery unlocking (allowing the player the automatically purchase), and the quality of patrons rising.</p>

                            <p>Each class has a notable strength in stat distribution (farmer is strength, shopkeep is speed, and of course the bard is charisma), and one particular special power (farmer has a double damage blow, the shopkeep has a fireball spell, and the bard is able to heal).</p>

                            <p>The special ability of the player can be used twice before it's locked out. Of this pool of two blows, one is also taken away every time a heavy strike is used.

                            <p><i>Manor Hill</i> was made with Ren'py engine, and one of my largest-scale projects to date. I handled sound editing (before sound was cut for time), writing, programming, and hiring artists for the sprites. In it, the player is a customizable (although non-visual) entity, who attends an annual Harvest Festival in their minor country, Uresa.</p>
                            <p>This year, however, proves to be different; in the midst of the festivities, the lights explode and the player is knocked unconscious. When they wake up, they're trapped in the mansion with only a single companion for company. All the remains is questions: why are you here, how do you leave, and what does your companion know?</p>

                            <p>Design assets were kindly gifted to me by my good friend and one of the artists on the projects, <a href="http://leylamamedova.com">Leyla Mamedova</a>. It's helped immensely in giving <i>Manor Hill</i> a more cohesive design than public domain assets had before.</p>

                            <p>Splashscreens were added as part of the push to .apk, to allow Chromebook users (and subsequently Android users with larger screens) to play the game after it became an executable instead of an HTML page.</p>

                            <p>Most of Gnarl's route depends on the player luck stat. It's built up as the player wins and loses random rolls, and determines the direction the narrative goes in.</p>

The head of an organizaed crime division in the country to the east of Uresa, Valerian is in town for the Festival. In the scene pictured, the player and Valerian are trying to decide where to look for an exit to the manor.</p>
                            <p>Valerian's route depends mostly on the friend/rival scale. Certain responses and decisions will built up either Valerian's fondness for the player as a friend or his respect for them as a rival, which will then adjust how he reacts to them.</p>

                            <p>This was a minor character study, written in the early days of <i>Hybrid</i> when it was meant to be a published novel. The publishing fell through but I felt the short was a good character exploration to carry into its development as an interactive narrative.</p>
                            <p>It follows Mantis, before she was a trick shot and back when she studied bugs, hoping to bring back the breadth of human knowledge one beetle at a time. Crave still works with animals here, but they're both working directly on behalf of the warlord Roach.</p>

                            <p>Crave has probably changed the most in development, both in image and accent. The speaking quirk was adjusted on feedback that it was difficult to follow on a large scale, and his image was changed to look more similar to Mantis.</p>

                            <p>One eternal constant in Mantis' story is how deeply and openly she hates Roach. Besides that she's remained largely consistent, besides losing her formal occupation when the camp turned to a drifter's haven instead of an abandoned campus.</p>

                            <p>This was originally written as a prep document for a short campaign I ran. It goes over locations and people within the village, giving brief political context for the players and short lists of merchant wares, all written as if in a letter from Ruciat.</p>

                            <p>Ruciat (going by Rock in the campaign) mentions multiple times that the team should not mention them to the denizens of Cenham, to try and avoid having them find out that their father leads the town, and letting their sibling know where they've gone.</p>
                            <p>Unsurprisingly, the party mentioned it to the first NPC they met.</p>

                            <p>This was meant to give the players an idea of the sort of trouble they'd encounter while within Cenham. They were there to solve the murder of a Direport diplomat (Direport having been created by another player), whom most of the town denied having ever seen before in their lives.</p>
                            <p>Most investigation had to be done either leveraging their passive knowledge of the town given to them by Ruciat (and in many cases, news on the bard passed as information as well) or by successfully intimidating or charming the townsfolk (neither of which happened very often).</p>

                            <p>Unbeknownst to the players, several characters they met along the way were actually the mortals who pretended at godhood, in order to more easily subjugate the island.</p>

                            <p>Despite how simple the code for this project turned out, it didn't start so straightforward. I looked at the source code for multiple similar projects to try and put something together, also using canvas for the first time. It was an exercise in trying to marry the Javascript that I wanted to use with the canvas I wanted to learn.</p>
                            <p>At first the "final" product was a refreshing starfield, which while I liked, I ultimately decided against because it didn't look intentional to have the falling stars continue to refresh to a different position.

                            <p>Made with Javascript and the Three.js library, <i>Centre of the Universe</i> was truly jumping into the deep end of coding and learning to swim from there.

                            <p>There was a steep learning curve involved in this process, and while there's a wealth of useful tutorials, some problems are too specific to easily research away. This was the case several times throughout the project, which necessitated trial and error. The source of the objects, textures, and materials in the scene can be found <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/low-poly-space-assets">here</a>.</p>

                            <p>There is a bug associated with this project that I haven't quite been able to discover the solution to. The textures are bugged; in the accompanying video, you can see that both the planet and its moon have different textures. This is achieved roughly 1/3rd of the time, depending on what browser is being used. It began with a permissions error that existed in the major browsers tested (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and IE).</p>
                            <p>This permissions error required me to run the site that the animation was embedded into through a local host service (in this case, <a href="https://github.com/greggman/servez">Servez</a>, though the bug is not necessarily specifically the fault of this program; node.js was also tested, and returned less frequent successful loads than Servez was able to). To keep it brief, the order in which the local hosts handles the permission requests vs loads the objects in the scene has a damaging effect on the displayed textures. Usually, both objects will load with the same texture.</p>
                            <p>Still, although the bug doesn't have a simple fix, I learned a wealth of things while I fussed around with the code. I've managed texture in both Blender and through pure MTL code, I worked with promises for the first time, I restructured the code just under a million times, and I did a boat load of research every time something came up that needed fixing (even if it couldn't be fixed).</p>

                            <p>Made with CSS animations, Sunrise/set was meant to be a relief from the arduous process of coding the other two; I knew the rotation would be fairly simple once I worked out where everything went, and I wanted to refresh my Photoshop skills.</p>

                            <p>The most involved part of thise code was positioning everything within the box, allowing it to realistically turn while also keeping everything in its place. Thankfully, CSS isn't as much of a struggle as JS Libraries can be: this was done fairly quickly and I could dedicate the rest of the deadline to creating a background.</p>
