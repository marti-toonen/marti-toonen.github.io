                        <p>Written in a modified version of Python and including regular Python code, <i>Manor Hill</i> is a game about mystery, trust, and the relationships between people.</p><br>
                        <p>A routine party goes terribly awry when the dancefloor goes south and you wake up trapped in the sprawling mansion on the hill. Cooperate with and investigate the eclectic guests while you search for a way out; and try to discover why you're there in the first place.</p>

                    <td>
                        <p>Written in ChoiceScript, a custom language by Choice of Games, <i>Bad Ritual</i> examines the relationship between groups, the necessity of vengeance, and people's ability to work together.</p><br>
                        <p>Your already high-risk/low-reward job gets about thirty times more dangerous when you inadvertently release an ancient archdemon into Sanctum City. Armed with only a recent promotion and the support of your enigmatic boss, it's up to you to decide what to do with Siruud the Devourer.</p>

                    <td>
                        <p>Written in the Harlowe language associated with Twine, <i>Hybrid</i> looks at the human relationship with nature, and the rebuilding of society after the apocalypse.</p><br>
                        <p>Long ago, the world stretched out its leafy green arms and strangled civilization for eons of misuse. She took herself back; and now, there's you. This is the only life you've ever known and after a violent raid destroys your farm, you set out to find what's happened to your only relative; but you find that the while the world looks the same as it always has, the people therein are not like you.</p>

                    <td>
                        <p>Written in C# using Unity game engine, <i>Platforming Pro</i> was a group project on which I was in charge of menus, bug-fixes, narrative design, and the display of text onscreen.</p><br>
                        <p>It bears resemblances to <i>Bad Ritual</i> as we needed a jumping off concept and it was created before <i>Bad Ritual</i> was released. <i>Platforming Pro</i> was designed as a demo, built in two months and meant to offer the opportunity for expansion. I was also responsible for our rudimentary Game Document and prioritizing features within the game for our deadline.</p>

                        <p>Written in C# using Unity game engine, <i>Escape Room VR</i> was a group project on which I was in charge of menus, set, sound, puzzle, and marrative design, and general bug fixes.</p><br>
                        <p>Made specifically for phone-based virtual reality, the three-person team (including myself) designed this demo in one month. The broad set pieces such as buildings and furniture were created within the team, with smaller more decorative pieces being free Unity assets. Our original goal was to create three rooms, but we quickly prioritized the first two in order to cater to our deadline.</p>

                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p>Written in Java, <i>Planet Crash!</i> was a revisiting of an earlier Java choose-your-own-adventure game made with a narrower code foundation.</p><br>
                        <p><i>Planet Crash!</i> displays knowledge of inheritance, composition, abstraction, file reading and writing, and problem-solving. In the game you play an occupant of a space ship that crash lands on an uninhabited planet, and must find answers about the crash before nightfall: if they manage to survive that long with succumbing to the stress of isolation.</p>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p>Written in C++, <i>Night Walk</i> was a project specifically designed to teach myself C++ programming more thoroughly and to experiment with a more flexible kind of console app.</p><br>
                        <p>This version of my console-based choose-your-own-adventure game is superior purely because there was a means for me to clear the console and avoid the overcrowding problems I have in Java. In <i>Night Walk,</i> the protagonist has just finished an overlong retail shift and must make their weary way back home after the bus doesn't come. They know the way, but not the dangers they face: it's best to keep a level head, though, to avoid succumbing to your own paranoia.</p>
